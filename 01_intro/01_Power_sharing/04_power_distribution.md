# Types of Power Sharing with Examples

Democracy mein power ko divide karna zaroori hota hai, aur yeh alag-alag levels par kiya ja sakta hai.  
Yeh 4 important types hote hain:

---

## 1. Horizontal Power Sharing

### 📌 Meaning:
Power ko **same level ke organs** ke beech share kiya jata hai.

### 🔄 Example:
- Legislature 🏛️
- Executive 🏢
- Judiciary ⚖️

👉 In teeno ke paas alag powers hote hain, aur ek doosre par **check** rakhte hain.

### 🧠 Real Example:
- India mein Supreme Court PM ko unconstitutional decision lene se rok sakta hai.
- PM kisi judge ko hata nahi sakta bina due process ke.

➡️ **Balance banaye rakhna** = Horizontal sharing

---

## 2. Vertical Power Sharing

### 📌 Meaning:
Power ko **different levels of government** ke beech share kiya jaata hai.

### 🔄 Levels:
- Central Government (Union) 🇮🇳
- State Government 🏞️
- Local Government 🏘️ (Panchayats/Municipalities)

### 🧠 Real Example:
- Police State subject hai, Defence Central ka.
- Nagarpalika garbage sambhalti hai, State hospital chalata hai, aur Central army control karta hai.

➡️ **Top to bottom sharing** = Vertical sharing

---

## 3. Community-Based Power Sharing

### 📌 Meaning:
Power ko **different social/ethnic/religious communities** ke beech share kiya jaata hai — taaki sabko representation mile.

### 🧠 Real Example:
- **Belgium**: Dutch & French-speaking communities ke liye alag-alag community governments.
- **India**: Minority rights (Muslims, Sikhs etc.) protect karne ke liye laws & institutions.

➡️ **Cultural ya identity-based sharing** = Community-based sharing

---

## 4. Power Sharing Among Political Parties, Pressure Groups, Movements

### 📌 Meaning:
Democracy mein alag-alag **political parties, pressure groups, aur movements** power share karte hain — elections ke through ya coalition governments ke zariye.

### 🧠 Real Example:
- **India**: BJP + allies milkar NDA banate hain — coalition government.
- **Farmers’ protest** ya **civil society movements** decisions ko influence karte hain.

➡️ **Participation-based sharing** = Political & Social sharing

# Power Sharing in Belgium vs Sri Lanka

## 🇧🇪 Belgium: Inclusive & Balanced Power Sharing

Belgium ne apne diverse population ko respect diya — aur **sab communities ko power mein equal role** diya.

### 🧩 How Power Was Shared:

1. **Among Communities (Community-based sharing):**
   - Dutch, French, and German-speaking logon ke liye alag community governments.
   - Har community apne culture, language, aur education handle karti hai.

2. **Among Government Levels (Vertical sharing):**
   - Central + State (regional) governments ke paas alag powers.
   - State governments language-based hain (Flemish, Wallonia, Brussels).

3. **Among Organs (Horizontal sharing):**
   - Legislature, Executive, Judiciary ke beech clear power division.
   - No organ can dominate others.

4. **Equal representation in central government:**
   - Dutch & French-speaking ministers ka **equal number**.

### ✅ Result:
- Ethnic conflict avoid hua
- Unity bani rahi
- Democracy strong hui

## 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka: Majoritarianism & Lack of Sharing

Sri Lanka ne apne Tamil minority ko power mein shaamil nahi kiya, aur is wajah se tensions badhte gaye.

### 🧩 How Power Was (Not) Shared:

1. **Only Sinhala community was favored:**
   - 1956: Sinhala Only Act passed (Tamil language ignore)
   - Government jobs & education mein bhi Sinhala logon ko preference

2. **No power at state/regional level:**
   - **Unitary government** — sab power central government ke paas.
   - Tamil areas ko koi autonomy nahi mili.

3. **No cultural autonomy:**
   - Tamil identity, language aur culture ko government ne recognize nahi kiya.

4. **Judiciary or law-making also biased:**
   - Legislature ne Tamil protests ke baad bhi laws change nahi kiye.
   - Courts effective protection nahi de paayi.

### ❌ Result:
- Tamil logon mein frustration badha
- Protests, civil war, violence
- Desh mein instability aa gayi
